## Robinhood Jupyter

Robinhood doesn't have a public API for usage and it also doesn't provide an easy way to export historical orders and dividends data. There are other solutions available where one has to provide credentials. 

Here is a method to get 'orders' API response from Chrome or other browser while logged in. This avoids giving credentials through unofficial API methods.

Robinhood Jupyter notenbooks show easy way to parse and export data for other analysis.
